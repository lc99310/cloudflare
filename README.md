wgcf.sh
Script to connect macOS to Cloudflare warp using Wireguard. To get started, brew install jq wireguard-tools

If you sudo killall wireguard-go it will shut down the tunnel and clean up almost all routing changes. One (harmless) route--used to force the Cloudflare WARP endpoint to bypass the tunnel--is left behind; I didn't know a trivial way to always remember which one I added :/.

(I also cache the private key, identity, and authorization tokens used for the account with Cloudflare in your home directory, so you might also want to eventually rm -rf ~/.wgcf. I originally made that cache less automatic, but decided this wasn't trying to be perfect ;P.)
